# 👶 Baby Vision Simulator

This project simulates how a baby sees the world at different ages (0–24 months), using your device’s camera and a real-time canvas filter.

It adjusts blur, contrast, and color saturation to reflect visual development stages based on pediatric research.

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Uses device camera (rear camera on mobile)
- 🎛️ Slider to select baby's age in months (0–24)
- 🧠 Visual filters based on real developmental data
- 📱 Mobile-friendly and responsive layout
- 💻 No dependencies – runs in any modern browser

## 🔬 Scientific Basis

Vision simulation is based on developmental milestones from [Naître et grandir](https://naitreetgrandir.com/fr/etape/0_12_mois/developpement/naitre-grandir-developpement-sens-vue/) and other pediatric sources.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
